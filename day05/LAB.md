## Lab

Today's lab will be composed of two sections:
1. Create a Beautiful MUI App
2. Final Term Project Discussion

### Create a Beautiful MUI App

Time to make your application pretty! Using the `react-mui` package , we will add MUI's styling to your application. Your goal is to create an app that shows the posts in your firebase DB using the [Album](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/album/) layout.

To expedite things, it is recommended to use the day04's lab as base, so all firebase setup is there.

To import MUI:
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @fontsource/roboto
npm install @mui/icons-material
```

Steps:
* Use the application you created from day04 as base
* Download [Album.js](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/v5.11.0/docs/data/material/getting-started/templates/album/Album.js)
* Put `Album.js` into your project and start working on adding firebase-related code to read posts from your DB and show the posts in the form of an album card.
* Your page should look like: https://ntut-web-by-alex-001.web.app

### Final Term Project Discussion

Your term project presentation is just around the corner. After finish the coding lab, gather your team and start white-boarding. Good luck!

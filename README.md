## Gudelines

Please follow these guidelines to keep the course experience smooth for everyone:
* Raise your hand for questions at anytime.
	* But do it in such a way that it wont be disruptive.
* If need to talk / answer phones, keep the volume down and do not disrupt others (and me!)
* Feel free to approach for more Q&A after class concludes.
* If you feel the course is of little use to you, feel free to do whatever you need to do.
 	* Again, do it in such a way that it wont be disruptive.
